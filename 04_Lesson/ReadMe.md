    ```
        01) bool a = (3 + 4 * 2 == 2 * 3) && (true + false / 2) What is the result of the 
            expression and state the reason. (Please do not write the code in VS!).
        02) Write a program that finds the sum of the digits of a given 4-digit
            number (Example: int a = 1298 Result: 1 + 2 + 9 + 8 = 20)
        03) Write a program that displays the single digits between 
            the digits of a given number on the screen (Example: int a = 1298 Result: 1.9)
        04) Ask Console.Readline to enter the user's age.
            If the user is less than 30 years old, print the user's age square on the screen
            If the age is between 30-40, print the last digit of the entered number on the screen
            If age is less than 0 or greater than 100, type "Did you enter incorrect information" on the screen
        05) When entering the value of the month, write a method that shows how gun it is and which chapter it is
        06) The methiod that finds the largest element of the array
        07) A methiod that finds the smallest element of an array
            Given numbers = [1,2,3,6,7,8,23,78,34,12]
        08) Write a method that finds the sum of odd numbers
        09) Write a method that prints the number of 3-digit numbers on the screen
        11) Write a method that separates single numbers and collects them in a separate array
        12) Sort the numbers from largest to smallest
        13) Connect 2 separate arrays.
        14) Return the last letter of the word entered by the user.
        15) Write the method that finds the Length of the given word or array.
