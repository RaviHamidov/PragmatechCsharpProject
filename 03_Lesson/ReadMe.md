    ```
        01) Set the algorithm of the String Substring method;
        02) Set the algorithm of the reverse method: input: hello, output: olleh
        03) An algorithm that verifies that a given word is a palindrome,
            for example: input: main, output: main (reads the same from left and right)
        04) Remove Allow algorithm to delete duplicate letters input: csharpcorner, output: csharpone c
        05) Build an algorithm to find the average value of 5 numbers;
        06) Build an algorithm that finds the area and perimeter of a rectangle;
        07) Build an algorithm that records the multiplication table of the entered number;
        08) Construct the algorithm of the sum of squares between the given numbers 1;
        09) Build an algorithm that calculates the difference 
            between the sum of the numbers between the numbers given by 0;
        
        Optional:
        10) Write a method that deletes spaces between words. For example: "hello my name is Mina";
        11) Set the algorithm of the Replace method,
        12) Set the algorithm of the split method.
